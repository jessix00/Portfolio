            <h2> About</h2>
            <p>I’m a desert native who’s lived in Phoenix, Arizona most of her life. Although I come from a diverse background, I’ve always had an interest in design and technology. In 2015, I taught myself HTML5 and CSS, this lead me to join a web development
                bootcamp where I continued to learn and grow as a developer.<br><br> A lot of the studying I currently do is from web tutorials and videos. I still find the best lessons are learned from completing real-world projects and for this reason,
                I’m always looking for ways to improve and build websites. <br><br>When it comes to work, I want to be involved in projects I find challenging with people that inspire me. Since programming has been such a big part of my life, I enjoy
                meeting others that share my passion.</p>
